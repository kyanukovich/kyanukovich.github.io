  <h1>Uh-Oh!</h1>

    <p>
      Well, this is embarrassing... I&rsquo;ve taken down my previously static
      website, which basically was a summary of my LinkedIn page with a ling to
      download a PDF of my resume, for a MASSIVE redesign that I was planning
      for so long, but never managed to dedicate enough time to accomplish, so
      this page would remain deserted for quite sometime. If you have an urge to
      contact me - feel free to
      <a href="mailto:yankirill@icloud.com">email</a> me whenever you want. I
      read my mailbox every at 9 AM in whatever time zone I might be located, so
      don't hesitate!
